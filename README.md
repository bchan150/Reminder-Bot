This project is still in development. I do plan adding more features aside from the basic need, and possibly creating a skeleton code to create multiple different personas for the bot. Currently, the persona is set to Paimon from the game Genshin Impact.
This code WILL NOT WORK without a Discord bot token. I do not plan on sharing this token, so please go to https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro and create a new bot and use their token.

Create a .bat file like this:
cd [DIRECTORY]
main.py [TOKEN]

Both files that have "REDACTED" had personal channels that I did not want shown. Copy the channel IDs from Discord and paste it on main.py in order for it to work.
